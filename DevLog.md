# Dev & Feelings Log

Yup. Log of my developemet AND _feelings_, because, yeah.. feelings. 

### Day 0 (Someday in June, 2018) 
The game idea came to me.

### Day 1 (Feb 16, 2019) 
First real actionable task towards bringing this game idea to life. Set up docs. GitHub, GDD in Notion, and experimented with Ink. [GDD here.](https://www.notion.so/bmmashat/The-Day-I-Opened-The-Fridge-Game-69d833d91b7f473e9475f9eceaeb8a05)

### Day 2 (Feb 19, 2019)
Wrote a rough draft for part 1! Includes the full conversation. You can access it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16gAga-8uIu6R6mer9m4d9gmwYIOU6H50HAn1Ma33y58/edit#gid=1559134232) <br>
Stat: full original converstaion: 333 lines. Reduced to: 196 lines.

### Day 3 (Apr 16, 2019) 
Okay.. Finally back phew! So, I prototyped the first part of the game using Ren'Py. Totally not as originially planned, but I made it as part of an assignment in my writing in games class (TCS 191). You can access the horribly made version [here.](https://bmmashat.itch.io/the-day-i-opened-the-fridge). Even though I got a very good feedback from my professor, I believe the dialogue is too long and draining so I definitly need to cut it down even more. Here's my professor's feedback: 
> _Excellent work! Much like Project 1, this story is thinking through the ways in which characters reach across the mediated channels of consciousness, speech, and communication devices to try (and fail) to make meaningful contact with one another. I don't know if I mentioned this in my previous comments, but have you read Waiting for Godot--a two-person dialogue built around existential anxiety and the attempts of two character to try (and fail) to communicate with each other? If you plan on building this world out, it might be interesting to look at some theatre, short stories, and film that is built around the psychic drama of quotidian conversation. Make sure to proofread the text and cut and paste the dialogue into a spell check before uploading--there are a few minor grammatical errors and typos that (I don't think) are deliberate. For ex, ninty instead of ninety, teproary, missing apostrophes, etc._

### Day 4 (May 7, 2019) 
Alright. I decided to make this game as my final project for my writing in games class (TCS 191). I just pitched it and people seem to be very excited.. Which makes me nervous! [Here is my pitch](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YInIJs9fiFnqte8Hz3Ug0oyNnVhcQ6Ftg02fu3GRNAI/edit?usp=sharing). <br>
I'm now having second thoughts.. Shall I make it using Ren'Py or? Well, for now I will just focus on the writing and then worry later about the UI. 

### Day 5 (May 10, 2019)
I spent more time polishing part one and reducing it to 113 lines! (was 196 lines). I still think it's too long though. Need to do some playtesting. I made a prototype on ink. It's accessible [here](https://bmmashat.itch.io/the-day-i-opened-the-fridge-part-one). 

### Day 6 (May 18, 2019)
Based on some feedvack (3 people), they felt the conversation flow was natural, so I decided to keep it as it is for now and start working on part 2. But before that, I added some styles to make it easier for reading (see picture below). I changed the background to dark, and I finally managed to change the color of the text! Phew! Thanks to Chrome's "Inspect" option, I was able to see how [this game](https://h-anklebone.itch.io/a-song-for-kharon) had styles. Turns out ink already had support of tags (#CLASS: <whatever>) and then you just add the class customization in the CSS file.

### Day 7 (May 19, 2019) 
I started and FINISHED part two. It's a draft though, I'm still not satisfied with it. And it's not like what I originally planned. This part you play from the perspective of one character (Blue), and players will have some choices to reveal more about the story. But I decided not to change the conversation and just add Blue's thoughts as the source of the "additional info" the player can get from this level. I might change this later but after testing to see how people react to it. Next step: write part 3! Part 2 is accessible [here](https://bmmashat.itch.io/the-day-i-opened-the-fridge-part-two). 

### Day 8 (May 24, 2019) 
Finished part 3. I'm not very satisified with it. I wrote it in rush. But at this point, I just want to finish the whole game, and then I will work on changing/improving the conversation. Part 3 is accessible [here](https://bmmashat.itch.io/the-day-i-opened-the-fridge-part-three). Next: combine part 1,2,3 together in one bulid.

### Day 9 (May 25, 2019) 
One problem I didn't account for is.. 

#### TODO: 
##### Next: 
- [x] update theme & colors for part one.
- [x] write part 3 
- [ ] wrtie part 4 (the conflict + the continuation of the conversation)
- [ ] implement the ending (audio + dedication)
- [ ] combine part 1,2, & 3
- [ ] combine everything together in Ink
- [ ] edits: fix spelling errors in part 2. Maybe some phrases (emotions.. gaurd down..)
- [x] style: colors
