# Dev & _Feelings_ Log

Yup. Log of my developemet AND feelings, because, yeah.. feelings. 

### day 1 (Feb 16, 2019) 
Set up docs. GitHub, GDD in Notion, and experimented with Ink. [GDD here.](https://www.notion.so/bmmashat/The-Day-I-Opened-The-Fridge-Game-69d833d91b7f473e9475f9eceaeb8a05)

### day 2 (Feb 19, 2019)
Wrote a rough draft for part 1! Includes the full conversation. You can access it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16gAga-8uIu6R6mer9m4d9gmwYIOU6H50HAn1Ma33y58/edit#gid=1559134232)

### day 3 (Apr 16, 2019) 
Okay.. Finally back phew! So, I prototyped the first part of the game using Ren'Py. Totally not as originially planned, but I made it as part of an assignment in my writing in games class (TCS 191). You can access the horribly made version [here.](https://bmmashat.itch.io/the-day-i-opened-the-fridge). Even though I got a very good feedback from my professor, I believe the dialogue is too long and draining so I definitly need to cut it down even more. And oh, here's my professor's feedback: 
> _Excellent work! Much like Project 1, this story is thinking through the ways in which characters reach across the mediated channels of consciousness, speech, and communication devices to try (and fail) to make meaningful contact with one another. I don't know if I mentioned this in my previous comments, but have you read Waiting for Godot--a two-person dialogue built around existential anxiety and the attempts of two character to try (and fail) to communicate with each other? If you plan on building this world out, it might be interesting to look at some theatre, short stories, and film that is built around the psychic drama of quotidian conversation. Make sure to proofread the text and cut and paste the dialogue into a spell check before uploading--there are a few minor grammatical errors and typos that (I don't think) are deliberate. For ex, ninty instead of ninety, teproary, missing apostrophes, etc._

### day 4 (May 7, 2019) 
Alright. I decided to make this game as my final project for my writing in games class (TCS 191). I just pitched it and people seem to be excited.. Which makes me nervous!
